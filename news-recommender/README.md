# News Recommender System
### This project is a News Recommender System built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide personalized news recommendations based on user preferences and interactions.
 
## Features
•	Personalized Recommendations: Tailors news articles to user preferences.
•	NLP Integration: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity for text analysis.
•	Interactive Interface: User-friendly design for ease of use.
•	Scalable Framework: Adaptable for integration with larger systems or live feeds.
 
## Dataset
The project uses a synthetic dataset. It preprocesses text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
 
## Methodology
1.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Cleaned and prepared the dataset.
o	Applied NLP techniques for text analysis.
2.	Model Development:
o	Built a recommendation model using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
3.	Evaluation:
o	Tested the system with sample user preferences.
4.	Deployment:
o	Designed for deployment in Jupyter Notebook.
